# Sandbox Simulation

This project is a simulation application where users can place and simulate elements such as sand, stone, and water on a canvas. Users can place elements with mouse clicks and control their properties using keyboard shortcuts. The simulation can be advanced step by step.

## Features

- **Sand**: Place sand elements on the canvas. Sand elements move downwards on the canvas.
- **Stone**: Place stone elements on the canvas. Stones do not move.
- **Water**: Place water elements on the canvas. Water interacts with sand and other water elements and moves accordingly.
- **Simulation**: Advance the simulation one step by pressing the `Enter` key.
- **Clear Canvas**: Clear the canvas by pressing the `R` key.
